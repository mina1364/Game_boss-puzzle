# Game_boss-puzzle
This is my first javascript game,I've studied computer Engineering-software at university and now living in Beautiful Vancouver,Bc and studying in Technical
Web Desiner program(Sep2017-March2018)
I've found javascript creepy at first but each time when I try it,I'm more into it.This game is a picture puzzle game and I want to improve the code
Also,I'm avaiable for other projects,Ofcourse something that I could handle it!(I'm very beginner).
